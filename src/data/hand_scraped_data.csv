Facebook,"Christchurch City Council staff have been forced to backtrack and remove a bus stop they placed in the middle of a busy vehicle lane, costing rate payers $90,000. We also discuss Aaron Keown's code of conduct, and the ""walk out"" of 5 councillors. Share your views:"
Facebook,"A prominent lawyer has strongly criticised the Christchurch City Council for its lack of consultation on the Park Terrace cycleway, prompting five councillors to walk out during her address."
Facebook,"Do you still think it's crazy that the Christchurch City Council wants to spend $33 million upgrading the streets around the new stadium site? 
Because despite intense public opposition, it's decided to press ahead with consultation.
It plans to take away just on 50 car parks, widen footpaths on some streets in the area to nearly six metres, put in more cycleways and lower the speed limit in the area to as low as 10 kilometres per hour.
How do you feel about this?
Call John at 9 on 0800 80 10 80 and tell him what you think."
Facebook,"A nationwide campaign to stop the Government's highly controversial water reforms kicks off in Christchurch today. The Tax Payers Union has produced a ""Stop Three Waters roadshow."" Local elected representatives have been invited to speak at 2pm. Location: Christchurch City Council forecourt (62 Worcester Boulevard) The event will be highly visual, with a ""Stop Three Waters"" branded campervan, signage, and distribution of merchandise. The full itinerary for the nationwide roadshow can be found at www.3watersroadshow.nz."
Facebook,"UPDATE: The lane has been restored for peak hour traffic.
****
Main North Road between Cranford Street and Northcote Road will remain reduced to one lane northbound over the weekend. Significant delays are expected during peak traffic periods. 
If you're heading to the Northwood/Belfast areas via Cranford Street, we suggest you use the Northern Corridor through to the Belfast Road exit and head back. 
Thanks for your patience and we will provide further updates as soon as we can."
Facebook,"The next phase of construction is getting underway on the Puari ki Pū-harakeke-nui Northern Line cycleway! From Monday 21 August, work will start along the railway corridor between Tuckers Road and Sturrocks Road, and between Barnes Road and Main North Road🚴‍♀️🚴‍♂️
The off-road cycleway follows the Main North Line railway and connects northern Christchurch suburbs to Riccarton and Central City, more on Newsline."
Facebook,-> Please put in crossing on Harewood road. With Mitre 10 there now it is way too busy to cross with my children which prevents us from using this cycleway
Facebook,-> What about the section from Kilmarock to Blenheim Road? And is there any plan to widen some of the narrow bits. Just south of Harewood Rd and just north of Wroxton Tce are too narrow for a cyclist to pass a pedestrian without the pedestrian leaving the path.
Facebook,-> Are there any plans for the 'crossing' at Langdons road? The road is so busy it is quite an unsafe place to cross on a bike
Facebook,"Did you know that most stormwater drains lead directly into waterways? 🐟💧
Litter, dirt and other contaminants can travel through the stormwater system and threaten water quality and aquatic life!
Want to help protect out waterways? Find out more below."
Facebook,"-> 🤔 how do you expect people to bin litter when you have taken all the bins out of your parks and reserves?
Cause the public aren’t taking their rubbish with them"
Facebook,"-> The rubbish bins in the carparks along Marine Parade were removed by CCC
Now the rubbish goes direct Into the ocean. This was a social experiment that has not worked. We need the bins back!"
Facebook,-> Got any comments about this CCC. Perhaps you should play your part too and fix the infrastructure around New Brighton and this would not happen all the time
Facebook,-> I did log one and your workers came and did this as a fix and then said the problem had been rectified. So I asked Mr Fix it Phil and Ms Baxendale if that was a satisfactory resolution and bingo four days later they came and redid it
Facebook,-> leak starts here in Collingwood Street. I think this building has something to do with orion. Been leaking for at least six years. But hey JW if you can action it hat's off to you. Cough cough 🤧 😬
Facebook,-> I have sent snap send solve numerous times. This is other side where the dirty stagnant water sits. Subject to funding I have been told
Facebook,"-> lol, i rang and told you about a water leak on Bealey Ave/Barbados st (that has been running for YEARS), that was months ago... no progress, surprised..not."
Facebook,"From 1 July 2024 in-house teams of Council staff will be created to maintain all parks maintenance activity, excluding tree maintenance and Sexton services, rather than contractors🌿🍄🌷
Making this move in-house allows more flexibility, means locally dedicated people will maintain local parks, and avoids spending more ratepayer money. This decision was approved by the Finance and Performance Committee at its 25 July meeting, more on Newsline: https://newsline.ccc.govt.nz/.../council-parks-to-be..."
Facebook,"-> This is what used to happen. Hopefully it will improve the state of our parks, including the access and tracks on and next to the Brighton sand dunes. They used to be well maintained."
Facebook,"In late 2022, a temporary disc golf course was established in Bottle Lake Forest. We're considering making the course permanent, and would like your feedback before making a decision!
Come along to Waitikiri Drive car park tomorrow (Saturday) at 10am for an open day to check it out for yourself, and take a look at the fun and challenging course for disc golfers🤸‍♂️🤸
For those unable to attend the open day, you can provide feedback until 31 August to letstalk@ccc.govt.nz."
Facebook,"Roads around Christchurch and Banks Peninsula are closing due to snow ❄️⛄️
LATEST ROAD CLOSURES - 12PM:
⚠️ Dyers Pass Road from upper Hackthorne Road to Governors Bay Road
⚠️ Dyers Pass Road intersection at Victoria Park Drive
⚠️ Summit Road and Godley Head at Evans Pass
⚠️ Summit Road from Dyers Pass Road to Gebbies Pass
⚠️ Sumner Road from Reserve Terrace to Evans Pass Road
⚠️ Purau Port Levy from Purau to Western Valley
⚠️ Little Akaloa Road 
⚠️ Summit Road from Pigeon Bay Road to Le Bons Bay Road
⚠️ SH75 from Little River to Duvauchelle"
Facebook,"Plans to make sections of busy Fendalton roads safer for all users are out for public feedback - and we want to know what you think!🚗
The proposal to upgrade sections of Glandovey Road and Idris Road between Fendalton Road includes installing new pedestrian refuge islands, speed cushions, cycle lanes, and kerb buildouts. Read more and provide feedback below👇"
Facebook,"-> “Pedestrian refuge” is quite the Freudian slip. Why should human beings need to take “refuge” from others driving steel death machines?
Put another way, is this city for people, or is it for cars?
Pedestrians should have the right-of-way in all circumstances. This is the only civilised policy. Anything less is barbarism.
NZ prices itself on being a kinder, gentler place than the USA, but this is one instance in which NZ has chosen brutality."
Facebook,-> As elected members of already pointed out ID like to endorse the point that I currently see these engagements as being a complete and utter waste of ratepayers money when the outcomes from them are usually pre-determined and result in the implementation of existing council policy that is already agreed on making these engagements and a necessary waste of public funds.
Facebook,"-> Removing most of the car parking on Glandovey Road is madness. My elderly neighbours will never be able to have visitors over with this new plan as visitors will have to park far from my neighbours houses. They tell us in most instances there will be enough parks left on the road, but there are very rarely available parks outside our place and they are taking away all but two across the road. Would love to see the research that brought them to this decision."
Facebook,"-> the ones on Tennyson Street are awful, I've seen people almost rear end others because they are slowing down for the bumps and people get impatient. Slowing down and accelerating 4 times to go one way, on top of that having to drive over them slower than 20 because they feel bad on the wheels. My fuel guage can definatly feel it that's for sure"
Facebook,"The unchlorinated water fill stations at New Brighton and Burnside pump stations will be permanently closed in the coming days to comply with drinking water laws.
Government water regulator Taumata Arowai has confirmed that the requirement to chlorinate Christchurch and Banks Peninsula water supply zones extends to the Council’s unchlorinated water fill stations. More on Newsline👇👇"
Facebook,"-> Ah, we have such caring and kind central Government, and complicit, gutless local councils 🤮"
Facebook,-> Absolutely ludicrous. No timely warning and all to do with money and power. Chlorine is awful for our bodies and health.
Facebook,"-> Our water tastes terrible and dries out our skin, bring back the good old days."
Twitter,But the Christchurch City Council still has $260 million to spend on a bloated sports stadium. #christchurchcitycouncil
Twitter,How about prioritizing calling our city by it's given name for a start. It's Christchurch.
Twitter,Why don't you focus on Christchurch and Banks Peninsula. That's what you are paid for.
Twitter,what happened to the tree that used to be here? Any plans to replace it?
Twitter,More daft spending. When’s the next speed reduction for the cardigan wearers coming ??
Twitter,Rapid Response Footpath Crews need to be extended to ensure cycleways are safe as well. Cleaning up leaves and glass need to happen ASAP. Today a parent/caregiver with their children on a bike lost traction on these leaves. Cycleways should not be in this state.
Twitter,Some questions for cyclists would've been nice!
Twitter,"we need this fact checked: Ali Jones, Community Board member for Waipapa Papanui-Innes-Central Community Board, has publicly stated the Board knew absolutely nothing about the the work on Park Terrace. Sadly, this appears to be another attack on CCC Staff."
Twitter,"Higher speed limits, more car parks, lower rates, English language in all signs. There you go."
Twitter,Born and raised in Christchurch. Never once heard it called otautahi. Woke fools.
Twitter,Stop calling it Otautahi. It’s Christchurch and always will be.

Twitter,"the way you are spending OUR money on rubbish projects we might as well go back to the horse and cart, you can pick up my horses back-end droppings."
Twitter,the packing machine is on Manchester Street and not accepting credit card or pay wave.
Twitter,Proper action on climate change must be at the top of the list
Twitter,IT’S CHRISTCHURCH FOOLS!
Twitter,Happy to have that rates increase as it means more money to spend on essential services. And make sure we get lots of dense housing *in the city* not on expensive green fields (which will unnecessarily drive up our rates even more!)
Twitter,We need to do more than just the basics. C'mon CCC pump up the rates and spend where you need to spend. Protecting your political backsides does not help your voters.
Twitter,is there a document outlining why Bewdley Street and Evesham Crescent are proposed special character areas? seem like pretty standard Christchurch streets to me
Twitter,can you please upskill your track maintenance team to cut harakeke properly? So many butchered plants up Te Heru o Kahukura
Twitter,"Call it Christchurch first, by its name, then we'll talk"
Twitter,"How about you put some effort into cleaning up basic infrastructure in NB that STILL hasn’t been fixed after the quakes??? We got munted bridges, munted roads & a local economy in the toilet. It’s been 12 years!! Bloody do SOMETHING!!"
Twitter,"Wow, glad my main residence is in Waimakariri district where they allow us a max draw of up to 2000L/day. Granted, we need to store it in a tank, but still..."
Twitter,"Car parks, increased speed limits, better roads for cars, rate cuts, axe all art work."
Twitter,Good. Our water is a precious resource. Hopefully this will encourage the tiny proportion of extremely high users to be more careful.
Twitter,no name in English I will not be using it. Go woke go broke. Is the Events Centre making money?
Twitter,"I thought you would’ve tried harder to reduce the rates bill. But, you’re all socialists who have a deep rooted fantasy that ratepayers have a room full of gold hidden away. Try harder."
Twitter,what's with the Bus Interchange bike parking? You have to go inside the building now to access it but then have to go outside the building to leave it (when you're trying to get in to the buses). That could be a real nuisance if you're in a hurry to catch a bus...
Twitter,what a beautiful area at Sumner Village. Only drawback -at the children’s play area the metal base of the roundabout was blisteringly hot. Maybe need a rethink.
