Facebook,"A prominent lawyer has strongly criticised the Christchurch City Council for its lack of consultation on the Park Terrace cycleway, prompting five councillors to walk out during her address.",negative
Facebook,"Do you still think it's crazy that the Christchurch City Council wants to spend $33 million upgrading the streets around the new stadium site? 
Because despite intense public opposition, it's decided to press ahead with consultation.
It plans to take away just on 50 car parks, widen footpaths on some streets in the area to nearly six metres, put in more cycleways and lower the speed limit in the area to as low as 10 kilometres per hour.
How do you feel about this?
Call John at 9 on 0800 80 10 80 and tell him what you think.",negative

Facebook,-> Please put in crossing on Harewood road. With Mitre 10 there now it is way too busy to cross with my children which prevents us from using this cycleway,negative
Facebook,-> What about the section from Kilmarock to Blenheim Road? And is there any plan to widen some of the narrow bits. Just south of Harewood Rd and just north of Wroxton Tce are too narrow for a cyclist to pass a pedestrian without the pedestrian leaving the path.,negative
Facebook,-> Are there any plans for the 'crossing' at Langdons road? The road is so busy it is quite an unsafe place to cross on a bike,negative

Cause the public aren’t taking their rubbish with them",negative
Facebook,"-> The rubbish bins in the carparks along Marine Parade were removed by CCC
Now the rubbish goes direct Into the ocean. This was a social experiment that has not worked. We need the bins back!",negative
Facebook,-> Got any comments about this CCC. Perhaps you should play your part too and fix the infrastructure around New Brighton and this would not happen all the time,negative
Facebook,-> I did log one and your workers came and did this as a fix and then said the problem had been rectified. So I asked Mr Fix it Phil and Ms Baxendale if that was a satisfactory resolution and bingo four days later they came and redid it,negative
Facebook,-> leak starts here in Collingwood Street. I think this building has something to do with orion. Been leaking for at least six years. But hey JW if you can action it hat's off to you. Cough cough 🤧 😬,negative

Facebook,"From 1 July 2024 in-house teams of Council staff will be created to maintain all parks maintenance activity, excluding tree maintenance and Sexton services, rather than contractors🌿🍄🌷
Making this move in-house allows more flexibility, means locally dedicated people will maintain local parks, and avoids spending more ratepayer money. This decision was approved by the Finance and Performance Committee at its 25 July meeting, more on Newsline: https://newsline.ccc.govt.nz/.../council-parks-to-be...",positive
Facebook,"-> This is what used to happen. Hopefully it will improve the state of our parks, including the access and tracks on and next to the Brighton sand dunes. They used to be well maintained.",positive

Facebook,"Plans to make sections of busy Fendalton roads safer for all users are out for public feedback - and we want to know what you think!🚗
The proposal to upgrade sections of Glandovey Road and Idris Road between Fendalton Road includes installing new pedestrian refuge islands, speed cushions, cycle lanes, and kerb buildouts. Read more and provide feedback below👇",positive
Facebook,"-> “Pedestrian refuge” is quite the Freudian slip. Why should human beings need to take “refuge” from others driving steel death machines?
Put another way, is this city for people, or is it for cars?
Pedestrians should have the right-of-way in all circumstances. This is the only civilised policy. Anything less is barbarism.
NZ prices itself on being a kinder, gentler place than the USA, but this is one instance in which NZ has chosen brutality.",negative
Facebook,-> As elected members of already pointed out ID like to endorse the point that I currently see these engagements as being a complete and utter waste of ratepayers money when the outcomes from them are usually pre-determined and result in the implementation of existing council policy that is already agreed on making these engagements and a necessary waste of public funds.,negative
Facebook,"-> Removing most of the car parking on Glandovey Road is madness. My elderly neighbours will never be able to have visitors over with this new plan as visitors will have to park far from my neighbours houses. They tell us in most instances there will be enough parks left on the road, but there are very rarely available parks outside our place and they are taking away all but two across the road. Would love to see the research that brought them to this decision.",negative
Facebook,"-> the ones on Tennyson Street are awful, I've seen people almost rear end others because they are slowing down for the bumps and people get impatient. Slowing down and accelerating 4 times to go one way, on top of that having to drive over them slower than 20 because they feel bad on the wheels. My fuel guage can definatly feel it that's for sure",negative
