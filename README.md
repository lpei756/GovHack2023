# Citizen Council Connect 

This project was developed as a contribution to the GovHack 2023 hackathon. It encompasses a React application designed to offer a comprehensive analysis of citizen survey data, while also serving as a platform for gathering valuable survey inputs to enhance our data repository. Our data sourcing primarily relies on the dataset provided by Christchurch Resident's Survey and manually web scraped data.

Key features of the application include:

1. Interactive Mapping: The ability to visualize and explore Christchurch Council's Outlined Activity, Scheduled Activity, Power Outage, and Water Shutoff incidents on an interactive map.

2. Analytical Dashboard: A dedicated dashboard that provides insightful visualizations and analysis based on the collected data.

3. Survey Form: An integrated survey form enabling citizens to contribute their feedback, thereby enriching the available dataset.

Through these functionalities, our application aims to enhance data-driven insights and provide a valuable resource for understanding citizen sentiments and activities within the Christchurch community.
